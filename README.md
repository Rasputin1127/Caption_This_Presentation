## Proposal 1 (High Difficulty)

I have had a longstanding interest in deepfakes, particularly in the context of political and celebrity fallout that is possible from sophisticated implementation of these false videos and pictures. Therefore, I am interested in discovering the process in creating a 'deepfake detector'. I imagine this will require some sort of autoencoder, and a good understanding of GAN's (though I don't think I will need to create one in order to create the 'detection' portion of this project). I feel like even if I don't end up with a model that works all that well, it may still be worth it to show off the technique and understanding if it is well presented. The deepfake videos I will use come from https://github.com/ondyari/FaceForensics/.

## Proposal 2 (Moderate-High Difficulty)

I thought it would be really interesting to learn the process of end-to-end speech recognition and the networks associated with that process. If I were able to get something running well enough, the idea is to have a presentation that uses the speech recognition in a live-action kind of way to show off its success. This repo has an assignment for a Udacity course that walks through some of the complexities, so I thought it would be a good starting point to build off from: https://github.com/lucko515/speech-recognition-neural-network.

## Proposal 3 (Moderate Difficulty)

Coming from Academia, I remember how tedious it was to scroll through 7 different academic job posting sites, or fumble through mountains of emails of job alerts systems to find an academic job that you were well suited for, so the idea here is to create an academic job recommender. I would scrape several academic job posting sites (HigherEd.com, philjobs.com, etc.) to get a corpus of the postings, then perform various techniques to create a similarity system. Then, I would build a flask app that asks a user to upload a resume and/or personal statement, which would be processed through the pipeline quickly (as only 1 or 2 documents) and then the similarity score would be used to recommend jobs based on things found in your own materials. Alternatively, if that becomes too difficult, then I could just build the app to ask for what areas of competence and areas of specialization you have to make the recommendation.

## Proposal 4 (Moderate? Difficulty)

The video game Okami has a really unique art style that is beautiful and even haunting in some respects. I would love to be able to train an autoencoder that trains on the Okami images from the concept art and from the videogame and 'learns' that style, which can then be used to process regular images and translate them into the Okami art style. The challenge here (apart from the autoencoder working well) is finding enough images to make this work. Just a brief search showed me where I could find ~200 images, plus whatever a google image search could turn up, but I would likely need at least a few more than this for the network to 'learn' the art style effectively. Some concept art can be found here: https://www.videogamesartwork.com/games/okami?page=15

## Proposal 5 (Unknown Difficulty)

Assuming you think these ideas are either too difficult, or not the right thing, then I will come up with more over the break and chat with you about what would be best to do!
